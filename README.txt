The Palindromic Number Calculator calculates the largest palindromic number between
a lower and upper boundary provided by the user.

# How to Use #

After opening the application, enter two values for the lower and upper boundaries.
The numeric range between and including the two boundaries will be searched for palindromic numbers.

The following rules are imposed on the two boundary values:

1) Both boundaries must be numeric, positive, whole number values according to the mathematical definition of a palindromic number.

2) The upper boundary must be greater than the lower boundary to successfully determine a numeric range.

3) Boundaries may not exceed the Java defined maximum integer value of 2,147,483,647 in order to prevent long waits and jeopardizing other running programs.

After selecting valid lower and upper boundaries, select the 'Calculate' button to determine the largest palindromic number in the given range. The user will be notified if no palindromic number is found.
